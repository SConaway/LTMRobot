# IRRobot
An Arduino-based Line Tracking Robot

Versions
===

Bluetooth Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/RobotContro/

Obstacle Avoiding Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/ObstacleAvoidingRobot/

IR Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/IRRobot/

Line Tracking Robot - https://github.com/SConaway/LTMRobot/

Based on:
===
*  Arduino UNO R3
*  L298N motor driver
*  3 Line Tracking Modules
Once code is uploaded, this becomes a remote-controlled robot.

I based it off of https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M2Z9ZTV/ with my own custom shield. Everything is the same for the Line Tracking Robot.
